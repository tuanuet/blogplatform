# Ideation Skill

## Purpose

Generate innovative ideas by breaking conventional thinking patterns and exploring the full solution space.

## When to Use

- When stuck with conventional solutions
- When needing fresh perspectives on a problem
- When exploring disruptive approaches
- When the obvious solution doesn't feel right

## Techniques

### Problem Reframing

Change HOW you ask the question to unlock new answers:

| Original Frame             | Reframed                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "How to reduce costs?"     | "How to increase value per dollar?"   |
| "How to fix bugs faster?"  | "How to prevent bugs from occurring?" |
| "How to speed up loading?" | "How to make waiting feel shorter?"   |
| "How to get more users?"   | "How to make users bring friends?"    |

```markdown
## Problem Reframing Exercise

**Original problem**: [Statement]

**Reframes**:

1. [Opposite frame]: How to...?
2. [User perspective]: What if users could...?
3. [Constraint flip]: If we had unlimited X, how would...?
4. [Scale shift]: If this was for 1M users, how would...?
5. [Time shift]: How would this work in 5 years?

**Most promising reframe**: #X because...
```

### Constraint Removal ("What If")

Remove constraints to explore possibilities:

```markdown
## Constraint Removal Analysis

**Current constraints**:

- Budget: $X
- Time: Y weeks
- Tech: Must use Z
- People: N developers

**What if** scenarios:

1. **No budget limit**: We would...
2. **No deadline**: We would prioritize...
3. **Any technology**: We would choose...
4. **Unlimited team**: We would parallelize...

**Insights from constraint removal**:

- Even with constraints, we can adopt: ...
- Priority should shift to: ...
```

### Cross-Domain Inspiration

Borrow solutions from other industries:

| Your Problem         | Similar Problem In | Their Solution                |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| User onboarding      | Gaming             | Tutorial levels, achievements |
| Inventory management | Supermarkets       | Just-in-time, expiry tracking |
| Recommendations      | Dating apps        | Matching algorithms, swipe UX |
| Trust building       | Hotels             | Reviews, verification badges  |

```markdown
## Cross-Domain Analysis

**Our problem**: [Description]

**Similar problems elsewhere**:

### Domain: [Gaming]

- How they solve it: ...
- Applicable to us: ...

### Domain: [Banking]

- How they solve it: ...
- Applicable to us: ...

### Domain: [Healthcare]

- How they solve it: ...
- Applicable to us: ...

**Synthesis**: Combine ideas from X and Y to create...
```

### Reverse Brainstorming

Think about how to FAIL, then invert:

```markdown
## Reverse Brainstorming

**Goal**: [What we want to achieve]

**How to GUARANTEE failure**:

1. Do [opposite of best practice]
2. Ignore [critical factor]
3. Never [important action]
4. Always [harmful behavior]
5. Make it hard to [user goal]

**Inverted solutions** (do the opposite):

1. → [Do best practice]
2. → [Focus on critical factor]
3. → [Always do important action]
4. → [Never do harmful behavior]
5. → [Make it easy to achieve goal]

**Prioritized actions**:

1. ...
2. ...
```

### Crazy 8s (Rapid Ideation)

8 ideas in 8 minutes:

```
┌───────┬───────┐
│ Idea 1│ Idea 2│
├───────┼───────┤
│ Idea 3│ Idea 4│
├───────┼───────┤
│ Idea 5│ Idea 6│
├───────┼───────┤
│ Idea 7│ Idea 8│
└───────┴───────┘
1 minute per box - no overthinking!
```

## Output Format

```json
{
  "technique_used": "Problem Reframing",
  "original_problem": "...",
  "new_perspectives": [
    { "frame": "User perspective", "insight": "..." },
    { "frame": "Scale shift", "insight": "..." }
  ],
  "breakthrough_ideas": ["...", "..."],
  "next_step": "Evaluate with solution-evaluation skill"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Suspend disbelief** - Don't dismiss "impossible" ideas
2. **Embrace constraints** - Constraints spark creativity
3. **Seek analogies** - The best ideas often come from elsewhere
4. **Iterate quickly** - Bad ideas lead to good ones
5. **Ask "What if?"** - Challenge every assumption
